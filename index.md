## About Me

I am a seasoned Data Scientist and AI/ML expert with over a decade of experience driving innovation across Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Remote Sensing, Satellite Image Processing, Earth Observations, Water Quality etc... I currently lead AI/ML and data science initiatives at Synectics, supporting a large federal organization in the United States, with a strong focus on mission-critical research and operational systems.

My work spans federal and academic research institutions including NASA, Supported Landsat calibration efforts to U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and South Dakota State University. I specialize in architecting scalable data science environments, automating complex analytical workflows, and deploying advanced AI/ML models to deliver actionable insights for decision-making.

I bring deep expertise in applying AI/ML to Earth observation, remote sensing, building Infrastructures to scentific mission projects, natural language processing, and scientific data systems. I am also an active reviewer and judge for national and international research and innovation programs and remain committed to advancing the state of intelligent systems through continuous learning and applied research.
